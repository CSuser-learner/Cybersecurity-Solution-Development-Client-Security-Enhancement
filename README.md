# Cybersecurity-Solution-Development-Client-Security-Enhancement

## Project Overview
A comprehensive security solution designed and implemented for a client company addressing industry-specific cybersecurity threats. The project involved risk assessments, intrusion detection, penetration testing, and security validation through a structured approach.

## Team Contributions
This project was a collaborative effort, and my **specific contributions** included:
- Conducting a detailed **risk assessment** and defining the project scope.
- Designing a **proof of concept** for intrusion detection systems (IDS) and anomaly detection.
- Setting up **triggered alerts on Splunk** and creating dashboards for security monitoring.
- Integrating **penetration testing exercises (red team)** and **defensive strategies (blue team)** for security validation.
- Configuring **firewall settings**, blocking vulnerable ports, and updating the OS to enhance system protection.
- Developing documentation, including **training materials and implementation guides** for seamless deployment.
- Delivering structured **project presentations** and engaging with stakeholders for approval.
- Authoring a **postmortem report**, detailing project findings, challenges, and lessons learned.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**: Splunk (Threat log monitoring for new account creation)
- **Firewall Configuration**: Blocking ports, patching, and OS updates for Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- **Penetration Testing**: Red team exercises using Metasploit (attacking Windows 7 instance)
- **Risk Assessment & Security Testing**: Evaluating security weaknesses and implementing mitigation strategies
- **Cybersecurity Documentation**: Writing detailed reports, training guides, and postmortem analysis
